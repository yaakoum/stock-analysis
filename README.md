## Overview of Project
Steve has recently graduated with his finance degree. His parents are very proud of him and would like to become his first clients. They have a problem with putting all their eggs in one basket and Steve has become concerned with their lack of diversification. He promised he would look into DQ stock that they're invested in as well as a list of other stocks that use renewable energy. 

### Purpose
Steve has provided a large list of stocks with extensive data. The dataset is simply too large to analyze manually and can open room for error. Hence why he has come to ask for our assistance in automating these processes. With the use of VBA and functions like "for loops" and "if functions", we were able to completely automate the process for him. Not only that but we went a step further to refactor the code and make it run quicker and more efficiently.

## Summary

### Pros and Cons of Using Refactored Code
- The highest likelyhood for Louise to succeed with her campaign launch would be for her to launch in May. Based on the data used, she would be twice as likely to succeed than fail or cancel her campaign.
- On the contrary, the worst time for her to launch her campaign would be in December. Compared to May, there was less than a third of the number of successful campaigns in December and was almost the same as the number of failed that month.
### How These Pros and Cons Impacted the Original Data
- It is very clear that Louise cuts her chances for success significantly if she chooses to make her goal higher or near $15k. As per the chart analysis 50% failed at that goal range. Although 67% succeeded between the $35k-$45k range, the quantity of campaigns in that range only totaled to 9. Meaning if she expects her budget to be higher than $10k, I would highly suggest to stay as close to the $10k range or even try to go lower to help her chances to succeed.
